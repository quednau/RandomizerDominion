# Dominion Randomizer

The card game *Dominion* requires choosing 10 cards to play with each match. Which allows for a lot of replayability.

What the *Dominion Randomizer* does: It randomly chooses cards from the Dominion base game and three of its expansions. It informs you when it has output the 10 cards needed to start a match of *Dominion*. And then it expects you to play with this randomly generated combination of cards and will judge you silently if you don't. Note however:

- This is mostly a coding exercise of mine to solve an everyday problem that came up
- Actually, I coded this (i.e. the basic version of this) spontaneously when playing Dominion with my kid and we wanted to choose cards randomly, and then I simply fleshed it out for a bit later
- This means it's, let's say, severely feature-limited: You can't choose which expansions to include and cards aren't given by card name but by expansion name and card number (some manual card counting on your end necessary - sorry!)
- Also, the GUI is in German language, because our *Dominion* version is in German language and I like consistency
- If you don't speak German and still want to use this, go ahead. Just please don't yell the German words angrily at the screen. Counter to popular believe, this is not how the German language works (most of the time)
- I may or may not continue working on this; at the same time, if anyone finds this useful, it can easily extended, the code isn't that complicated, really
- Furthermore, I just now realize how ridiculous it is to have such a verbose readme for such a cute little script
- Which gives me the idea to write a little program that crawls over GitHub projects, counts the amount of characters in the respective readme-files and sets them in relation to-
- Wait, no, stop it, me - this readme needs to end here. This has gone on long enough. This readme, I mean.
